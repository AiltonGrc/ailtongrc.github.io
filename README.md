# Tiddlywiki and GitHub Pages
This is a demo repository shows how to integrate Tiddlywiki 5 and GitHub Pages to create a website. This demo is based on **Tiddlywiki single html file model**, while it can use subfolder for extra materials like images, pdfs,... in separate folder.

**Important**: This method works for older Tiddlywiki like TW 5.1.15. This method *Does Not* use the new GitHub Saver mechanism introduced in Tiddlywiki 5.1.20+
